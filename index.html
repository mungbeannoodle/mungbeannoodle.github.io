        <p>There are huge medical disparities and inequalities in treating queer people.<br><br>Many LGBTQ+ individuals are unable to find safe and affirming healthcare due to their home, environment, or location.<br><br>Many medical spaces also do not provide gender-affirming care for and recognition of transgender, non-binary, and genderqueer individuals.<br><br><br>

        <h3>Queer people experience discrimination in healthcare.</h3>
        <p>"Nearly a sixth of LGBTQ adults have experienced discrimination at the doctorâ€™s office or in another health care setting, while a fifth say they have avoided seeking medical care out of fear of discrimination, according to a recent poll." - Alvin Powell, <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/03/health-care-providers-need-better-understanding-of-lgbtq-patients-harvard-forum-says/" target="_blank">The Harvard Gazette</a><br></p>

        <p>LGBTQ+ people experience more "poor therapeutic alliance, lack of appropriate illness-related education, inadequate scheduled screening for communicable diseases, and inadequate interventions to prevent STDs." - Hafeez et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3426593/" target="_blank">The National Library of Medicine</a><br></p>

        <h3>Queer people lack LGBTQ-competent healthcare providers.</h3>
        <p>A National Academies of Medicine report found that "a significant contributor of health care inequities in LGBT patients is the lack of provider training and medical education." - Rowe et al., <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6370394/" target="_blank">The National Library of Medicine</a></p>
